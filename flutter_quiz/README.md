Created while following along with Academinds updated flutter course on udemy

## Notes

To run on an ios emulator
    In a terminal rune open -a Simulator
    In Vs Code click Debug, select Dart & Flutter
To run on an android emulator
    Open Android studio
    Open the android folder from the flutter project in Android studio
    Click Tools > AVD manager > Create virtual device > select your settings
    Once this is done once VS code will remember it and it can be run the same as the ios device
